To create a solana spl memecoin token launch pad, that allows a user to upload an image, choose a ticker for a token, pay the service fees and deploy their token as a 1 billion supply spl token on the solana blockchain. Here is how I want it to work: Use these as guidelines to build the project off of. 

Our intention is to make it as fair launch as possible, all whilst maintaining the lowest transaction fees on the solana blockchain for token deployment. Not only will this website be a token launchpad, it will also allow the user to deploy the token and than when it reaches a certain percentage, the bonding curve, the liquidity is injected into either a raydium liquidity pool or meteora

I will include details on this in the project. 

Pump prevents rugs by making sure that all created tokens are safe. 

Each coin on pump is a fair-launch with no presale and no team allocation. 

step 1: pick a coin that you like 

step 2: buy the coin on the bonding curve 

step 3: sell at any time to lock in your profits or losses 

step 4: when enough people buy on the bonding curve it reaches a market cap of $69k

step 5: $12k of liquidity is then deposited in raydium and burned

Fair Launch No pre-sale, no insiders, max 1B supply Ownership renounced, immutable 

Fully audited smart contracts 

Buy and sell at any time 

Once market cap reaches 432 SOL (~$66.9K)

all remaining tokens and liquidity migrate to Meteora or Raydium 

Also impement a Launch, Lock & Earn - launch on Meteora and earn LP rewards for life! 

Meaning that All liquidity is locked forever
